# FPS-OCR
Created an Image Recognition Program for determining FPS 

Developed a program to retroactively analyze the frames per second of Twitch Streamer G2 Jankos (+15000 viewers and 1 million followers) in past streams playing League of Legends.

Implemented a Python program to cut a video into segmentations and then cropped them using Pillow to where the FPS values were visible.

Using Python-tesseract the text values of each cropped image were exported showing FPS in past stream VODs.

Data was written up and final results can be found under Final Results
